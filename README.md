# Novatra Learning Initiative

Novatra Learning Initiative is a digital education platform designed to simplify access to high-quality learning resources. It aims to bridge the gap between students, educators, and modern technology by creating a space for collaborative and accessible learning.

# About the Project

Students can discover and enroll in learning programs.
